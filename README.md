# HOST_TOAST

## What is HOST_TOAST?

HOST_TOAST is a web hosting program similar to apache.
It hosts any static html code with ease. It automatically loads to localhost:8080.

## How do I use HOST_TOAST?

HOST_TOAST can be run by having an index.html file in the same location as the program. After that, simply open HOST_TOAST and open "Localhost:8080"
in your chosen web browser.

## Can I make my site viewable to other users?

Sadly, you can't make a localhost without other programs. We recommend using Localxpose, localtunnel, or ngrok to Make your site public to other users.


# DISCLAIMER! HOST_TOAST is in beta stages and is not stable enough for large or complex websites!
