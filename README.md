# HOST_TOAST

## What is HOST_TOAST?

HOST_TOAST is a web hosting program similar to apache.
It hosts any static html code with ease. It automatically loads to localhost:8080 but this can be changed in the code.

# How do I use HOST_TOAST?

HOST_TOAST can be run by having an index.html file in the same location as the program and simply opening HOST_TOAST.
It requires python 3 to run (PYTHON 2 not tested) and a web browser to open.

# Will HOST_TOAST gain any new features?

Yes. Our next update will allow the url to be your ip adress and have your site be public (HOPEFULLY)


# DISCLAIMER! HOST_TOAST is in beta stages and is not stable enough for enterprise sites
